# Optimize Performance

Analyze and optimize code for better performance.

{{#if selection}}
## Code to Optimize

```
{{{ selection }}}
```
{{/if}}

## Optimization Areas

1. **Time Complexity** - Reduce algorithmic complexity
2. **Space Complexity** - Minimize memory usage
3. **I/O Operations** - Batch, cache, or parallelize
4. **Rendering** - Reduce re-renders, virtualize lists (frontend)
5. **Database** - Query optimization, indexing (backend)

## Output

Provide:
1. Optimized code
2. Performance improvement explanation
3. Benchmarks or metrics (if applicable)
4. Trade-offs (readability, memory, etc.)
