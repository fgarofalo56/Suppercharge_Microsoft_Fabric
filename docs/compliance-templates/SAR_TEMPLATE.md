# Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Template

> **Home > Documentation > Compliance Templates > SAR**

---

## Overview

This template provides guidance for identifying, documenting, and filing Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) as required by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and FinCEN regulations.

---

## Regulatory Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Authority** | FinCEN / Bank Secrecy Act |
| **Form** | FinCEN SAR (Form 111) |
| **Filing Deadline** | 30 days from detection |
| **Retention** | 5 years |
| **Threshold** | No minimum - pattern-based |

---

## Suspicious Activity Indicators

### Structuring Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Detection Query |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Structuring** | Multiple transactions just below $10K | Sum within 24hrs approaching $10K |
| **Smurfing** | Multiple people depositing for one player | Same beneficiary, multiple sources |
| **Chip Walking** | Converting cash to chips, cashing out without play | High buy-in, minimal play, quick cashout |
| **Minimal Gaming** | Large transactions with little actual gaming | Coin-in/buy-in ratio < 10% |

### Behavioral Indicators

- Reluctance to provide identification
- Multiple transactions in short time periods
- Unusual nervousness during transactions
- Transactions inconsistent with player profile
- Use of multiple player cards
- Cash purchases of chips followed by immediate cashout

## Data Extraction Query

### PySpark - Identify SAR Candidates

```python

    Identify transactions requiring SAR review.

    Patterns detected:
    1. Structuring: Multiple transactions $8K-$9.9K within 24 hours
    2. Minimal gaming: High buy-in with < 10% play-through
    3. Rapid cashout: Cashout within 30 minutes of buy-in

## Automated Alerts Configuration

### Real-Time KQL Alert

```kql
// Real-time structuring alert for Eventhouse
FinancialTransactions
| where TransactionType in ("CASH_IN", "CHIP_PURCHASE")
| where Amount between (8000 .. 9999)
| summarize
    TransactionCount = count(),
    TotalAmount = sum(Amount),
    Transactions = make_list(pack("id", TransactionId, "amount", Amount, "time", TransactionTimestamp))
    by PlayerId, bin(TransactionTimestamp, 24h)
| where TransactionCount >= 2 or TotalAmount >= 18000
| extend AlertSeverity = case(
    TransactionCount >= 3, "HIGH",
    TotalAmount >= 25000, "HIGH",
    "MEDIUM"
)
| project
    AlertTime = now(),
    PlayerId,
    TransactionCount,
    TotalAmount,
    AlertSeverity,
    Transactions
```

---

## Record Retention

| Record Type | Retention Period |
|-------------|------------------|
| SAR filing | 5 years from filing date |
| Supporting documentation | 5 years from filing date |
| Investigation notes | 5 years from filing date |
| Negative decisions | 5 years from review date |
| Training records | 5 years |
