## Data Source Configuration

### Direct Lake Connection

The semantic model uses Direct Lake mode for optimal performance:

```
OneLake (lh_gold lakehouse)
    └── Delta Tables
         ├── gold_slot_performance
         ├── gold_table_analytics
         ├── gold_player_360
         ├── gold_financial_summary
         ├── gold_compliance_reporting
         └── gold_security_dashboard
```

### Connection String Format

```
Data Source=powerbi://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/[workspace-name];
Initial Catalog=[lakehouse-name];
DirectLakeConnection=True
```

### Required Permissions

| Permission | Scope | Purpose |
|------------|-------|---------|
| Viewer | Lakehouse | Read Gold layer tables |
| Contributor | Semantic Model | Modify measures/relationships |
| Admin | Workspace | Manage report deployment |

## How to Import into Fabric

### Method 1: Via Lakehouse UI

1. Open `lh_gold` lakehouse in Fabric
2. Click **New semantic model**
3. Select all Gold layer tables
4. Configure relationships per `setup-guide.md`
5. Add measures from `dax-measures.md`

### Method 2: Via TMDL Import

1. Export semantic model as TMDL from an existing model
2. Replace table/measure definitions with files from this directory
3. Import modified TMDL to Fabric workspace

### Method 3: Via Power BI Desktop

1. Connect to OneLake with Direct Lake mode
2. Import tables from `lh_gold`
3. Create relationships and measures
4. Publish to Fabric workspace

See `setup-guide.md` for detailed step-by-step instructions.

## Report Distribution

### Scheduled Delivery

| Report | Audience | Frequency | Format |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Executive Dashboard | C-Suite | Daily 7 AM | Email embed |
| Slot Operations | Floor Managers | Real-time | Dashboard |
| Compliance | Compliance Team | Daily 8 AM | PDF |

### Row-Level Security

RLS is configured for zone-based access:

```dax
// Users see only their assigned zones
[Zone Filter] =
    gold_slot_performance[zone] IN VALUES(SecurityTable[UserZone])
```

---

## Performance Optimization

### Pre-Aggregation

Gold layer tables are pre-aggregated for optimal Direct Lake performance:
- Daily grain for historical analysis
- Hourly grain for operational dashboards
- Optimized with Z-ORDER on frequently filtered columns

### Best Practices

1. **Limit columns** - Only include needed fields in semantic model
2. **Use measures** - Avoid calculated columns for complex logic
3. **Filter early** - Apply filters at data source level
4. **Limit visuals** - Maximum 6-8 visuals per report page

---

## Maintenance

### Monthly Tasks

- [ ] Review measure performance
- [ ] Validate data quality scores
- [ ] Update threshold parameters
- [ ] Archive old report versions

### Quarterly Tasks

- [ ] Review with business stakeholders
- [ ] Add new measures as needed
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Performance benchmark

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Fallback to DirectQuery | Complex DAX or large table | Simplify measures, add filters |
| Stale data | Delta table not refreshed | Check pipeline status |
| Missing relationships | New tables added | Update semantic model |
| Slow visuals | Too much data scanned | Add filters, pre-aggregate |

### Support

- **Technical:** Review `troubleshooting` section in setup guide
- **Business:** Contact casino analytics team
- **Fabric:** Microsoft Fabric documentation
