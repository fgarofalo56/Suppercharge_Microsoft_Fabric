## Step 2: Copilot for Data Factory

Data Factory Copilot helps you create and modify data pipelines using natural language.

### Creating a Pipeline with Copilot

1. Open **Data Factory** in your workspace
2. Click **Create** > **Data Pipeline**
3. Name it: `pl_copilot_daily_slot_load`
4. Look for the **Copilot** button in the toolbar
5. Click to open the Copilot pane

### Casino Example: Daily Slot Data Pipeline

**Prompt:**
```
Create a pipeline that:
1. Copies slot machine data from the Bronze lakehouse to Silver lakehouse daily
2. Runs a notebook to transform and cleanse the data
3. Sends an email notification if the pipeline fails
4. Runs every day at 2 AM
```

**Copilot Response:**

Copilot will generate a pipeline with:
- Copy activity: Bronze to staging
- Notebook activity: Transformation
- Failure notification: Email on error
- Trigger: Daily schedule at 2 AM

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Pipeline["pl_copilot_daily_slot_load"]
        A[Copy Data] --> B[Run Notebook]
        B --> C{Success?}
        C -->|Yes| D[Complete]
        C -->|No| E[Send Email]
    end

    TRIGGER[Daily 2 AM] --> A

    style Pipeline fill:#4CAF50,color:#fff
```

### Activity Suggestions

When adding activities, Copilot suggests:

| Context | Suggestion |
|---------|------------|
| After Copy activity | "Add Data Flow for transformations" |
| After Notebook | "Add validation query" |
| On failure path | "Add notification activity" |
| Large data copy | "Enable parallel copy" |

### Expression Generation

**Prompt:**
```
Create an expression that gets yesterday's date in YYYY-MM-DD format
```

**Copilot Response:**
```
@formatDateTime(addDays(utcNow(), -1), 'yyyy-MM-dd')
```

### Best Practices for Data Factory Copilot

| Do | Do Not |
|---|---|
| Be specific about source and target | Use vague descriptions |
| Include data volume hints | Assume Copilot knows your data |
| Specify error handling | Forget failure scenarios |
| Request schedule details | Leave timing ambiguous |

---

## Step 3: Copilot for Notebooks

Notebook Copilot is your AI pair programmer for PySpark, Python, and SQL code.

### Accessing Notebook Copilot

1. Open a Notebook in your workspace
2. Attach to your Lakehouse
3. Click the **Copilot** icon in the toolbar
4. The Copilot chat pane opens on the right

### Code Generation: Casino Player Lifetime Value

**Prompt:**
```
Write PySpark code to calculate player lifetime value (LTV) from the slot_transactions table.
Include:
- Total coin_in and coin_out per player
- Calculate net gaming revenue (NGR) as coin_in - coin_out
- Average session duration
- Number of visits
- LTV as NGR * predicted future visits (assume 2x historical visits)
```

**Copilot Response:**

```python
from pyspark.sql import functions as F
from pyspark.sql.window import Window

# Read slot transactions
df_transactions = spark.read.table("lh_silver.slot_transactions")

# Calculate player metrics
player_ltv = df_transactions.groupBy("player_id").agg(
    F.sum("coin_in").alias("total_coin_in"),
    F.sum("coin_out").alias("total_coin_out"),
    F.avg("session_duration_minutes").alias("avg_session_duration"),
    F.countDistinct("session_id").alias("visit_count"),
    F.countDistinct(F.to_date("transaction_timestamp")).alias("unique_days")
)

# Calculate NGR and LTV
player_ltv = player_ltv.withColumn(
    "net_gaming_revenue",
    F.col("total_coin_in") - F.col("total_coin_out")
).withColumn(
    "predicted_future_visits",
    F.col("visit_count") * 2  # Assumption: 2x historical
).withColumn(
    "lifetime_value",
    F.col("net_gaming_revenue") / F.col("visit_count") * F.col("predicted_future_visits")
)

# Display results
display(player_ltv.orderBy(F.desc("lifetime_value")).limit(100))

# Save to Gold layer
player_ltv.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("lh_gold.player_lifetime_value")

print(f"Calculated LTV for {player_ltv.count()} players")
```

### Code Explanation

Select existing code and ask Copilot to explain:

**Prompt:**
```
Explain this code in simple terms
```

**Before (Complex Code):**
```python
window_spec = Window.partitionBy("player_id").orderBy("transaction_timestamp").rowsBetween(Window.unboundedPreceding, Window.currentRow)
df = df.withColumn("cumulative_spend", F.sum("coin_in").over(window_spec))
```

**Copilot Explanation:**
```
This code calculates a running total of coin_in for each player:

1. Window.partitionBy("player_id"): Groups data by player, so calculations
   are done separately for each player

2. orderBy("transaction_timestamp"): Orders transactions chronologically
   within each player's group

3. rowsBetween(unboundedPreceding, currentRow): Includes all rows from
   the beginning up to the current row

4. F.sum("coin_in").over(window_spec): Calculates cumulative sum of
   coin_in using the defined window

Result: Each row shows the total amount the player has wagered up to
that point in time.
```

### Error Debugging

When you encounter an error, Copilot can help debug:

**Error Message:**
```
AnalysisException: Column 'player_id' does not exist. Available columns: [PlayerID, TransactionDate, Amount]
```

**Prompt:**
```
Fix this error
```

**Copilot Response:**
```python
# Column names are case-sensitive. Use the actual column name:
df = df.select(
    F.col("PlayerID").alias("player_id"),  # Standardize naming
    F.col("TransactionDate").alias("transaction_date"),
    F.col("Amount").alias("amount")
)
```

### Documentation Generation

**Prompt:**
```
Generate documentation for this function including docstring, parameters, returns, and example usage
```

**Before:**
```python
def calculate_theo_win(coin_in, hold_percentage):
    return coin_in * hold_percentage
```

**After:**
```python
def calculate_theo_win(coin_in: float, hold_percentage: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate theoretical win (house advantage) from slot machine play.

    Theoretical win represents the expected revenue the casino will earn
    from a given amount of play, based on the machine's hold percentage.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coin_in : float
        Total amount wagered by the player in dollars.
    hold_percentage : float
        The machine's hold percentage (e.g., 0.08 for 8% hold).
        This is the inverse of the payback percentage.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Theoretical win amount in dollars.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> calculate_theo_win(1000.00, 0.08)
    80.0

    >>> calculate_theo_win(5000.00, 0.12)
    600.0

    Notes
    -----
    - Industry standard hold percentages range from 2% to 15%
    - Actual win will vary from theoretical due to variance
    - Used for player reinvestment calculations and comp ratings

    See Also
    --------
    calculate_actual_win : Calculate actual win from session data
    calculate_player_rating : Rate player based on theoretical win
    """
    return coin_in * hold_percentage
```

## Step 4: Copilot for Power BI

Power BI Copilot enables natural language report creation and DAX formula generation.

### Creating Reports from Prompts

1. Open **Power BI** in your workspace
2. Create a new Report connected to your semantic model
3. Click the **Copilot** button
4. Enter your request

### Casino Example: Top Players Report

**Prompt:**
```
Create a report showing top players by region with:
- A bar chart of total spend by region
- A table of top 10 players with name, loyalty tier, and total spend
- A card showing total revenue
- A slicer for date range
- Use casino theme colors (dark green and gold)
```

**Copilot Response:**

Copilot generates a report page with:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Report["Top Players by Region Report"]
        direction TB

        subgraph Header["Header"]
            CARD[Total Revenue Card: $12.5M]
            SLICER[Date Range Slicer]
        end

        subgraph Body["Body"]
            BAR[Bar Chart: Spend by Region]
            TABLE[Table: Top 10 Players]
        end
    end

    style Report fill:#1a1a2e,color:#FFD700
    style Header fill:#16213e,color:#fff
    style Body fill:#0f3460,color:#fff
```

### DAX Formula Generation

**Prompt:**
```
Create a DAX measure that calculates month-over-month growth percentage for total coin_in
```

**Copilot Response:**

```dax
MoM Growth % =
VAR CurrentMonth = [Total Coin In]
VAR PreviousMonth =
    CALCULATE(
        [Total Coin In],
        DATEADD('Date'[Date], -1, MONTH)
    )
RETURN
    IF(
        PreviousMonth = 0 || ISBLANK(PreviousMonth),
        BLANK(),
        DIVIDE(CurrentMonth - PreviousMonth, PreviousMonth, 0)
    )
```

### Narrative Summaries

**Prompt:**
```
Add a narrative summary that describes the key insights from this report
```

**Copilot Response:**

```
## Key Insights - Player Performance

**Regional Performance:**
The Western region leads with $4.2M in total gaming revenue,
representing 34% of total revenue. The Eastern region follows
at $2.8M (22%).

**Top Player Trends:**
- Diamond tier players account for 45% of total revenue
- Average spend per Diamond player: $125,000
- Platinum tier shows highest growth at 18% MoM

**Notable Changes:**
Revenue increased 12% compared to last month, driven primarily
by increased visitation from loyalty program members.
```

### Q&A Natural Language Queries

Use Q&A to ask questions about your data:

| Question | Response |
|----------|----------|
| "What was total revenue last week?" | Card showing $2.4M |
| "Show me players from Nevada" | Filtered table |
| "Compare weekend vs weekday revenue" | Comparison visual |
| "Which machine type has highest hold?" | Bar chart with rankings |

---

## Step 5: Copilot for Data Warehouse

Data Warehouse Copilot assists with T-SQL query generation and optimization.

### T-SQL Generation

**Prompt:**
```
Write a query that finds players who have visited more than 10 times
in the last 30 days but have not visited in the last 7 days
(potential churn risk)
```

**Copilot Response:**

```sql
-- Players with high historical engagement showing recent disengagement
-- Potential churn risk candidates for marketing outreach

WITH PlayerVisits AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CAST(visit_timestamp AS DATE)) as visits_last_30_days,
        MAX(visit_timestamp) as last_visit_date
    FROM gaming.fact_player_sessions
    WHERE visit_timestamp >= DATEADD(DAY, -30, GETDATE())
    GROUP BY player_id
)
SELECT
    pv.player_id,
    p.player_name,
    p.loyalty_tier,
    p.email,
    pv.visits_last_30_days,
    pv.last_visit_date,
    DATEDIFF(DAY, pv.last_visit_date, GETDATE()) as days_since_last_visit
FROM PlayerVisits pv
INNER JOIN gaming.dim_player p ON pv.player_id = p.player_id
WHERE pv.visits_last_30_days >= 10
    AND pv.last_visit_date < DATEADD(DAY, -7, GETDATE())
ORDER BY pv.visits_last_30_days DESC;
```

### Query Optimization Suggestions

**Before (Slow Query):**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM gaming.fact_slot_transactions
WHERE YEAR(transaction_date) = 2024
AND MONTH(transaction_date) = 1
```

**Copilot Optimization:**
```sql
-- Optimized: Use date range instead of functions on columns
-- This allows the query optimizer to use indexes efficiently

SELECT
    transaction_id,
    player_id,
    machine_id,
    coin_in,
    coin_out,
    transaction_date
FROM gaming.fact_slot_transactions
WHERE transaction_date >= '2024-01-01'
    AND transaction_date < '2024-02-01'

-- Optimization notes:
-- 1. Replaced YEAR/MONTH functions with date range comparison
-- 2. Selected specific columns instead of SELECT *
-- 3. Query can now use index on transaction_date column
```

### Schema Suggestions

**Prompt:**
```
Suggest indexes for the player_sessions table to optimize
frequent queries by player_id and date range
```

**Copilot Response:**

```sql
-- Recommended indexes for player_sessions table

-- Primary query pattern: Filter by player + date range
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_player_sessions_player_date
ON gaming.fact_player_sessions (player_id, session_start_time)
INCLUDE (session_duration, total_spend, games_played);

-- Pattern: Date-based reporting
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_player_sessions_date
ON gaming.fact_player_sessions (session_start_time)
INCLUDE (player_id, total_spend);

-- Pattern: High-value player lookup
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_player_sessions_spend
ON gaming.fact_player_sessions (total_spend DESC)
INCLUDE (player_id, session_start_time)
WHERE total_spend > 1000;
```

---

## Step 6: AI Skills in Fabric

Beyond Copilot, Fabric offers additional AI capabilities.

### AI Skills Overview

| Feature | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **ML Models** | Train and deploy models | Churn prediction |
| **Cognitive Services** | Pre-built AI models | Sentiment analysis |
| **AI Functions** | SQL-callable AI | Text classification |
| **Semantic Link** | Data science integration | Feature engineering |

### Using AI Functions in SQL

```sql
-- Use AI to classify player feedback sentiment
SELECT
    feedback_id,
    feedback_text,
    ai.sentiment(feedback_text) as sentiment_score,
    CASE
        WHEN ai.sentiment(feedback_text) > 0.6 THEN 'Positive'
        WHEN ai.sentiment(feedback_text) < 0.4 THEN 'Negative'
        ELSE 'Neutral'
    END as sentiment_category
FROM gaming.player_feedback;
```

### Custom AI Skills

Create custom AI skills for domain-specific tasks:

```python
# Register a custom AI skill for player categorization
from semantic_link import register_ai_skill

@register_ai_skill("categorize_player")
def categorize_player(total_spend: float, visit_frequency: int) -> str:
    """
    Categorize player based on spend and visit patterns.

    Returns: 'Whale', 'Regular', 'Casual', or 'At-Risk'
    """
    if total_spend > 100000 and visit_frequency > 20:
        return 'Whale'
    elif total_spend > 10000 and visit_frequency > 10:
        return 'Regular'
    elif visit_frequency < 3:
        return 'At-Risk'
    else:
        return 'Casual'
```

---

## Step 7: Prompt Engineering Best Practices

Effective prompts lead to better Copilot responses.

### The CLEAR Framework

| Element | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **C**ontext | Provide background | "In a casino gaming environment..." |
| **L**anguage | Specify technology | "Using PySpark and Delta Lake..." |
| **E**xpectation | Define output format | "Return a DataFrame with columns..." |
| **A**ctions | List specific steps | "1. Read data, 2. Transform, 3. Save" |
| **R**estrictions | Set boundaries | "Do not modify existing tables" |

### Prompt Comparison

| Poor Prompt | Better Prompt |
|-------------|---------------|

## Step 8: Data Privacy and Security

### How Copilot Handles Your Data

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Your Tenant["Your Microsoft 365 Tenant"]
        DATA[(Your Data)]
        PROMPT[Your Prompt]
    end

    subgraph Processing["Azure OpenAI Service"]
        LLM[Large Language Model]
        PROCESS[Generate Response]
    end

    subgraph Security["Security Measures"]
        ENCRYPT[Encrypted in Transit]
        BOUNDARY[Compliance Boundary]
        NOLOG[No Data Retention]
        NOTRAIN[Not Used for Training]
    end

    PROMPT --> ENCRYPT --> LLM
    LLM --> PROCESS --> ENCRYPT
    ENCRYPT --> RESPONSE[AI Response]

    DATA -.->|Schema Only| LLM

    style Security fill:#27ae60,color:#fff
```

### Key Security Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Encryption** | All data encrypted in transit and at rest |
| **No Retention** | Prompts not stored after processing |
| **No Training** | Your data never used to train models |
| **Compliance** | Respects tenant compliance boundaries |
| **RBAC** | Copilot respects existing permissions |

### Best Practices for Sensitive Data

| Do | Do Not |
|---|---|
| Use column names, not actual values | Include PII in prompts |
| Describe data patterns generically | Paste sensitive data into prompts |
| Reference table schemas | Share credentials or keys |
| Use sample/synthetic data references | Include SSN, credit cards, etc. |

### Compliance Considerations

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Regulations["Regulatory Compliance"]
        GDPR[GDPR]
        CCPA[CCPA]
        HIPAA[HIPAA*]
        GAMING[Gaming Regulations]
    end

    subgraph Controls["Copilot Controls"]
        GEO[Geographic Processing]
        AUDIT[Audit Logging]
        ACCESS[Access Controls]
        DISABLE[Disable Options]
    end

    GDPR --> GEO
    CCPA --> AUDIT
    HIPAA --> ACCESS
    GAMING --> DISABLE

    style Regulations fill:#e74c3c,color:#fff
    style Controls fill:#27ae60,color:#fff
```

> **Note:** *HIPAA compliance requires additional configuration. Consult Microsoft documentation.

## Step 9: Limitations and Considerations

### What Copilot Does Well

| Capability | Reliability |
|------------|-------------|
| Standard code patterns | High |
| Common SQL queries | High |
| Basic DAX measures | High |
| Code explanation | High |
| Documentation generation | High |
| Simple transformations | High |

### What Copilot May Struggle With

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Complex business logic | Break into smaller prompts |
| Domain-specific calculations | Provide formulas explicitly |
| Highly optimized queries | Review and tune manually |
| Compliance-specific code | Validate with compliance team |
| Novel patterns | Start manually, ask for refinement |

### Validation Checklist

Always validate Copilot output:

- [ ] **Correctness**: Does the logic match requirements?
- [ ] **Performance**: Is the query/code efficient?
- [ ] **Security**: Are there any security concerns?
- [ ] **Compliance**: Does it meet regulatory requirements?
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Does it handle nulls, empty data, etc.?
- [ ] **Testing**: Have you tested with real data?

### When NOT to Use Copilot

| Scenario | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Highly confidential calculations | Risk of prompt logging |
| Regulatory filings | Requires human verification |
| Production-critical without review | AI can make mistakes |
| Extremely complex logic | May produce incorrect code |
